## Introduction

This website includes all the online projects I have created over time. 

It has 3 pages: 

1. Home
2. Projects
3. Contact

Their main sections in HTML are:

* Head
* Body
* Nav
* Header
* Main
* Footer

For the moment, it uses only HTML and CSS, without Javascript. 
It's been developed using the "mobile first" approach and has some media queries to make it properly responsive.
